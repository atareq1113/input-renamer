# laylo-input-renamer
A lightweight JavaScript userscript that renames duplicate verification code fields on laylo.com to enable Jancy's autofill functionality

Laylo Verification Code Renamer is a userscript created to address a specific challenge encountered on the verification page of laylo.com. The autofill system in Jancy was unable to target the input fields because they all shared the same name attribute. This script dynamically renames the duplicate verification code input fields by assigning them unique names, ensuring that Jancy's autofill functionality can accurately locate and fill the verification code fields.
